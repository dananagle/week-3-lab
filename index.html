    <h3> SWIMMING IS GREAT FUN!</h3>

        <p> The sun did not shine it was too wet to play, so we sat in the house all that cold, cold wet day.  I sat there with Sally, we sat there, we two and I said how I wished we had something to do.  Too cold to go out and too wet to play ball, so we sat in the house, we did nothing at all.  And all we could do was just sit, sit, sit, sit.  And we did not like it, not one little bit. But then something went bump, how that bump made us jump.  We looked and we saw him step in on the mat, we looked and we saw him the cat in the hat. </br></br>
          And he said to us "Why do you sit there like that?  I know it is wet and the sun is not sunny, but we can have lots of good fun that is funny.  I know some good games, I could show them to you, your mother will not mind at all if I do. <a href="">Mother</a>.

        <p> We never know how high we are until we are called to rise, and then if we are true to plan, our statures touch the skies.  The heroism we recite would be a daily thing, did not ourselves the cubits warp for fear to be a king. <a href="">Emily Dickenson</a> Whose woods these are, I think I know, His house is in the village, though, he will not see me standing here, to watch his woods fill up with snow.  My , between the woods and frozen lake, coldest evening of the year. Do shambling hands and feet indict a prophesy against delight?</br></br>
          My life closed twice before its close, it yet remains to see, if immortality reveal a third event to me.  So hard so hopeless, these that twice befell, parting is all we know of heaven and all we need of hell.  Yes, often I have wondered why, we two were born so, you and I.  Does ugliness recall afresh, the mortal defect of the flesh?  Yet take that man whose height averred itself the height of the absurd.  That goose necked fellow used to stare all privacy from earth and air.  A halting hope , a stumbling doubt, we are men's souls turned inside out.  And the tears that we suppose drain off, only into the narrow trough of self, instead are swirled around the sorrows of the world.</p>

    <p> <a href="">Blessings on Thee</a> little man, barefoot boy with cheek of tan, With thy turned up pantaloons and thy merry whistled tunes. With the sunshine on thy face through thy torn brims jaunty grace, With all my heart I wish thee joy, I was once a barefoot boy.</p>
